Using TagSoup with Scala XML:

import org.ccil.cowan.tagsoup.jaxp.SAXFactoryImpl
import scala.xml.factory.XMLLoader
import scala.xml.{Elem, XML}

object TagSoupXmlLoader {
  def get(): XMLLoader[Elem] =
    XML.withSAXParser(SAXFactoryImpl().newSAXParser())
}


join paragraphs split by a note
deal with parentheses
introduce corrections (e.g., in chapter 51 of Tanya, the kind of the note is wrong)

peel off the 'span' (in the beginning of a paragraph)

Editorial note
In the beginning of a side-note (only?) there may be a title
break paragraphs into lines
