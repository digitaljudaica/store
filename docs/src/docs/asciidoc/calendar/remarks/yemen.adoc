TODO Kapach and Hazak

// TODO translation of Kapach's introduction: https://mhcny.org/pdf/Introduction%20to%20Mishneh%20Torah.pdf[]

// TODO see p.37-41 for Hazak's list of the versions of Rambam with misprints corrected,
// and the reason they chose the Kapach version: it being based solely on the Yemenite
// manuscripts that were not affected by the censorship unlike the Ashkenazic ones
// and the Frenkel version being combination of various manuscripts and editions
// (which is funny, since Kapach repeats Askenazic misprints in the Laws of the
// Sanctification of the Moon)

// Both Chabad follow-ups to Hazak use the same "nusach".

// Quaint: they solicit corrections... by fax :)
