There is a point on the Sun's orbit (and on orbits of the other seven planets) such that when the planet is there it is the highest above Earth.
This point of the Sun's orbit (and so for other planets, except for the moon) rotates with constant speed.
Its movement every seventy years is approximately one degree.
This point is called <<gva-hashemesh>>.
Its movement in ten days is one and a half seconds, half a second being thirty thirds.
It follows that its movement in a hundred days is fifteen seconds.
Its movement in a thousand days is two minutes and thirty seconds.
Its movement in ten thousand days is twenty-five minutes.
It also follows that its movement in twenty-nine days is a bit more (TODO!) than four seconds; and its movement in a regular year is fifty-three seconds.
