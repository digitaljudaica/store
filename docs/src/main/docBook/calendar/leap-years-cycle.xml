  <title>Meton's cycle</title>

  <para>
  Show why 19-years cycle is the best.
  Calculate optimal distribution of the leap years.
  </para>

  <para>- 1:2 Solar year is ~11 days longer than the lunar (see chapter 6);
  when discrepancy accumulates to ~30 days, year is made leap.
  - 4:1-2 Leap year - additional Adar;
  Pesach (15th of Nisan) must be not before the vernal equinox (Sun enters Aries, see 9:3)
  and before the next summer solstice.</para>

  <para>Moznaim:
  Based on Sanhedrin 13a-b, the Ramah (cited in Kessef Mishneh on law 15):
  "Succos must be after the autumnal equinox"; Rambam doesn't mention this.
  With vernal equinox on Nissan 15th, autumnal could be on Tishrei 21st, 6 days into Succos.
  Ohr Sameach: Rambam did say this, printers missed it.
  Aruch HaShulchan: Rambam holds that that Sanhedrin isn't law; we only care about vernal equinox.</para>

  <para>QUESTION: what are the properties of the fixed calendar in this respect
  (need true seasons)?</para>

  <para>- 6:3 Lunar month (between conjunctions) = 29d12h793p.
  - 6:4 Lunar year (12 lunar months) = 354d8h876p = 354d8h48m40s;
  Leap lunar year (13 lunar months) = 383d21h589p;
  Solar year = 365d6h (see also 9:1, 10:6);
  longer than the lunar year by 10d21h204p.
  - 6:10 19 year cycle (12+7 leap); because the difference between 19 solar years and
  the cycle is less than a day: 1h485p.
  (see 10:1 - with a different year length, the difference is 0)</para>

  <para>QUESTION: what other lengths of the cycle have this property?</para>

  <para>- 6:11 Leap years: 3,6,8,11,14,17,19.</para>

  <para>QUESTION: in what sense is this an optimal correspondence?
  and for different cycle lengths? It is possible that true Sun calculations are needed to answer those questions...</para>
