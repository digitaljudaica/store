                     "The Holy One, blessed be He, showed to Moshe, in a prophetic vision, the image of the Moon, and said to him:
                     '<span class="phrase">When</span> you see <span class="phrase">the Moon</span> like this - sanctify

            <p>By how much is the solar year longer than the lunar year? By approximately 11 days. Therefore, when this excess
                     accumulates to around 30 days, or a little less, or a little more, a month is added and the year is made to have
                     13 months - which is called a "pregnant" year. [This is done] because it is impossible to have a year of 12 months
                     and some days, as it is said: "for the months of the year" - you count the months of the year, but not the days of
                     the year.<a href="#ftn.d0e992" class="footnote" name="d0e992"><sup class="footnote">[5]</sup></a>

            <p>Each month, the moon becomes hidden for about two days, or a little less or more: about one day before its
                     conjunction with the sun at the end of the month, and about one day after its conjunction with the sun, and in the
                     evening it is sighted in the west. The night when it is sighted in the west after being hidden is the beginning of
                     the month. We count 29 days from that day; if the moon is sighted on the 30th night, the 30th day is the first day
                     of the [next] month. If it is not sighted, first day of the [next] month is the 31st day, and the 30th day belongs
                     to the previous month. On the 31st night, we do not depend on the moon, regardless if it is visible or not, since
                     lunar month is never longer than 30 days.

                     sighted, and the previous month has 30 days, it is called "pregnant" month, or "full" month.
                     The moon sighted on the 30th night is called "moon sighted on time". If it is sighted on the 31st night, but
                     not on the 30th night, it is called "moon sighted on the night of pregnancy".

                     establishes the day as the beginning of the [new] month does it become the beginning of the [new] month.
                     As it is said: "this month shall be for you" - this testimony is entrusted to you.

            <p>The court calculates, like the astronomers who know positions of the planets and their movements,
                     and look into it until they know if it is possible for the moon to be sighted on time - that is, on the 30th
                     night - or not. If they determined that it is possible for it to be sighted, they sit and wait for withnesses
                     all day - that is, the 30th day. If the witnesses did come and were examined in accordance with the law, and
                     their words were accepted - they sanctify it. If the moon was not sighted and the witnesses did not come,
                     they complete the 30 days and the month will be "pregnant". If they found out from calculations that it is
                     impossible to sight the moon, they do not sit during the 30th day and do not await the witnesses.
                     And if the witnesses did come, it is certain that they are false witnesses or that they saw a likeness of the
                     moon in the clouds and not the real moon.

                     But, if there was a man great in wisdom, and ordained in the Land of Israel, who came out of the Land, and
                     there remains no one equal to him in the Land of Israel, he can calculate and establish month, and declares
                     "pregnant" years outside of the Land. If he becomes aware that in the Land of Israel there appeared a man as great
                     as him - or, needless to say, greater than him - he is prohibited to establish and to proclaim outside of the Land,
                     and if he transgressed and did establish or did proclaim, it is as if he didn't do a thing.
