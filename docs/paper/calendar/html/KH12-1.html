         <p>The mean rate of movement of the sun in one day (that is, twenty-four hours)
            is fifty-nine minutes and eight seconds, in symbols - 59&#8242;8&#8243;.
            It follows that its movement in ten days is nine degrees fifty-one minutes
                  and twenty-three seconds, in symbols - 9&deg;51&#8242;23&#8243;.
                  It also follows that its movement in a hundred days is ninety-eight degrees
                  thirty-three minutes and fifty-three seconds, in symbols - 98&deg;33&#8242;53&#8243;.
                  It also follows that remainder of its movement in a thousand days, after you
                  subtract all [multiples of] 360&deg; (as was explained) is two hundred sixty-five
                  degrees thirty-eight minutes and fifty seconds, in symbols - 265&deg;38&#8242;50&#8243;.
                  It also follows that the remainder of its movement in ten thousand days is
                  one hundred thirty-six degrees twenty-eight minutes and twenty seconds,
                  in symbols - 136&deg;28&#8242;20&#8243;.
         </p>
         <p>And in this way you can multiply and calculate its movement for any number
                  [of days] that you want.
                  Similarly, if you want to make known to you values of its movement for two
                  days, three, four and so on to ten - do it.
                  Similarly, if you want for to have known and ready values of its movement
                  for twenty days, thirty, forty and so on to a hundred - do it.
                  This is clear and known once you know its movement in 1 day.
         </p>
         <p>And you should have ready and known to you mean movement of the Sun for
                  twenty-nine days and for three hundred and fifty-four (which is the number of
                  days in the lunar year when its months are "regular" (TODO link), and it is
                  called "regular year"). The reason is: if you have those movement values ready,
                  these calculations of the visibility of the moon will be easy, because there
                  are twenty-nine complete days from the night of observation to the night of
                  observation of the following month, and so it is every month: no less than
                  twenty-nine days and no more.
                  Since our sole desire in all those calculations is exclusively to determine
                  visibility [of the moon].
                  And between the night of sighting of this month and night of sighting of the
                  same month next year there is either a regular year or a year and 1 day;
                  and the same every year.
                  Mean movement of the Sun in twenty-nine days is twenty-eight degrees
                  thirty-five minutes and one second, in symbols - 28&deg;35&#8242;1&#8243;.
                  Its movement in a regular year is three hundred forty-eight degrees,
                  fifty-five minutes and fifteen seconds, in symbols - 348&deg;55&#8242;15&#8243;.
