## [] - 2018-04-12

## [] - 2017-09-17
- switched to Gradle
- switched to Git
- added LICENSE
- added Travis configuration
- used F-bounded type parameters, projections and self-types to encode family polymorphism for Calendar and NumberSystem 
- used type parameters to encode Interval and Point in the NumberSystem family
- [yay!] split family members out of the family trait
- derived Calendar from TimeNumberSystem to tie the knot
- merged everything other than the paper into the same repository again
- introduced BigRational and used it for the NumberSystem's operations
- [yay!] Number is a sum of (a sequence of) signed terms which is not assumed to be in 'normal' form
- all operations in NumberSystem are done in terms of sequences
- Rosh Hashana corrections *really* externalized
- introduced Zodiac
- coded more astronomical calculations from Rambam
- more tests
- cleanup

NOTE: Scala compiler crashed (!!!) with the typing on Number/TimeNumber.
When family members are inside the family trait, it gets in the way (Family.this.T...);
To work around it, I tried using [T <: NumberSystem[T], N <: T#Number[T, N]].
It did the trick - I think - on the NumberSystem, but once I modified TimeNumberSystem in this way,
I got compiler crash!
Splitting the NumberSystem and TimeNumberSystem *helped* the knot-tying:
everything compiles and works!
